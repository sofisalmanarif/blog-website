Node.js is a powerful platform for building scalable and efficient web applications. It is widely used for creating RESTful APIs, which are essential for modern web development. This guide will help you get started with building RESTful APIs using Node.js, covering the basics and providing resources for further learning.

## Why Use Node.js for RESTful APIs?

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient.
- **JavaScript Everywhere**: With Node.js, you can use JavaScript on both the frontend and backend, streamlining development.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Node.js has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as Express.js, to simplify API development.
- **Scalability**: Node.js is designed to handle multiple connections simultaneously, making it ideal for building scalable APIs.

## Setting Up Node.js

1. **Download and Install**: Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download the latest version of Node.js. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and type `node --version` to ensure Node.js is installed correctly.
3. **Choose a Framework**: Popular frameworks for building RESTful APIs with Node.js include [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Koa](https://koajs.com/), and [Hapi](https://hapi.dev/).

## Basic Example

Here's a simple example of a RESTful API using Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
});
