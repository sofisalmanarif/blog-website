# Introduction

JavaScript closures are a fundamental concept that every JavaScript developer should understand. They are widely used in various programming patterns and are essential for mastering JavaScript. This guide will help you get started with understanding JavaScript closures, covering the basics and providing resources for further learning.

## What are JavaScript Closures?

- **Function with Preserved Data**: A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.
- **Encapsulation**: Closures allow for data encapsulation, enabling private variables and functions.
- **Use Cases**: Commonly used in callbacks, event handlers, and functional programming patterns.

## Basic Example

Here's a simple example of a closure in JavaScript:

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
